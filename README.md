  1.1945/1946 ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer)-it was the first general-purpose electronic computer that made it possible for stored-program computing.
  2. 1956 FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslation)- it was the first high-level programming language designed for scientific computing.
  3. 1957 COBOL (COmmon Business-Oriented Language)-it was the first programming language designed for businness applications.
  


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  1. Planning- involves gathering of information from the customer and documenting them.
  2. Design- creating blueprints for the software. This include the user interface, system interface and the database.
  3. Testing- this involves checking whether the software is operating correctly and if it meets the required requirements.
  4. Deployment- the software is moved to the working environment. It is installed in devices, configured and the users are trained on how tovuse the software.
  5. Maintenance- the softwareis monitored for performance and security issues that may arise.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
CONTRAST
In the approach feature, waterfall is linerar and sequential while agile is iterative and incremental.
In the flexibility feature, waterfall has low flexibility while agile has high flexibility.
In the requirements feature, waterfall is well-defined and stable while agile is evolving and adaptible.
In the planning feature, waterfall has a thorough upfront while agile is iterative and ongoing.





Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
ROLES OF A SOFTWARE DEVELOPPER
  1. Software design and development- they analyse the users needs and requirements to create funtional software solutions. These include designing the software, writing code and developing the software applications.
  2. Testing and debugging- they are responsible for testing the created software if it meets the requirements and debug the software for any bugs in the system.
  3. Deployment and maintenance-to deploy the software to the various platforms and monitoring the software performance while also identifying areas of improvement.
  4. collaboration and communication- they collaborate with other software developers and designers leading to exchange of information and knowledge.
ROLES OF A QUALITY ASSURANCE ENGINEER
  1.Testing and verification-they creaate test plans, test cases and test data to cover various scenarios. They also analyse the test results identifying the root defects and reporting issues to development teams.
  2. Quality assurance- the y impliment and maintain QA processes, standards and contols. They also ensure compliance with industry standards.
  3. Problem identification and solution- They identify and document defects, bugs and errors in a software.
  4. continuous improvement- they identify opportunities for improvementwhile staying up-to-date with the latest testing tools.
  5. Documentation- they maintain up-to-date documentsbof the test plans, test cases and defect reports.
ROLES OF A PROJECT MANAGER
  1. Project planning- They develop various project plans including the timelines, resource allocations and task assignments.
  2. Estimating project costs- They estimate the budget of the project and the required resources which can be in software, personnel and tools required.
  3. managing project schedule and milestones- They monitor against the project schedule and identify the potential delays in the project while implimenting the corrective actions.
  4. manging project risks- identify any potential risks to the project and develop the mitigation strategies while monitoring their effectiveness.
     
  

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IMPORTANCE OF IDEs (eg. Eclipse, Visual Studios, Codelite)
  1. Enhanced Productivity: IDEs provide code completion, syntax highlighting, and refactoring tools, this reduces the coding time and errors.
  2. Improved Collaboration: IDEs support version control integration, enabling multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously.
  3. Enhanced Code Quality: IDEs perform static analysis, identifying potential errors and code smells early in the development cycle.
  4.Enhanced Developer Experience: IDEs offer a customizable and ergonomic environment, providing a comfortable and efficient coding experience.
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
   Rapid technological advancement- the software development landscape is constantly evolving and the software engineers must be up-to-date with the evolution by learning and adapting.
  debugging complex code- this is a challanging and time consuming process.
  managing tight deadlines and project scopes- software projects have tight deadlines which put pressure on the developers.
  miscommunication- proper communication is vital for the success of a software project, hence any miscommunication can lead to errors in the project which take time to solve.
  security- software systems are prone to cyber attacks which are hagrmful to the system.
Scalability-scalability issues lead to bottlenecks on performance reducing user experience.
SOLUTIONS
  1. installing good anti-virus and anti-malware systems to prevent cyber attacks while keeping u p with latest security threats.
  2. Installing good means of communication among the developers.
  3. Having the team managers impose on realistic deadlines reducing pressure on the developers
  4. Careful planning and design to ensure the software can keep up with the increasing number of users.

IMPORTANCE OF VCS (eg. Git, subversion)
  1. Collaboration- vcs allow multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without interfering with each other. This provides a mechanism for merging changes from different developers into a common code base.
  2. Change tracking- vcs track every change made in the codebase hence providing a detailed history invaluable for debugging and understanding the evolution of the project.
  3. Easy rollbacks- incase of a break-in in the project, developerds can easily revert to the previous stable version.
  4. Branching and merging- vcs enable developers to create branches of the codebase to work on new features and debug the system in isolation. Once the changes are made they can be merged to the main code.
  5. code integrity- due to tracking changes and easy code rollbacks, integrity in the code is maintained.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
UNIT TESTING- a software testing method that verifies the correctness of individual units of code.
IMPORTANCE OF UNIT TESTING
  Help catch defects early in the process
  It imroves the quality of code
  it facilitates refactoring
INTEGRATION TESTING- verifies how different modules or components of a software application interact and work together after individual unit testing, ensuring they function as intended when combined.
IMPORTANCE OF INTEGRATION TESTING
  Early detection of integartion issues- helps identify different problems that arise when different modules interact.
  Ensures seamless functionality- integartion testing verifies that differnt components work together seamlessly, ensuring software works as intended.
  Improved Software Quality and Reliability- when integration issues are detected and resolved early,the software quality is improved.
  Reduced Costs and Time- by reolving and solving integration issues early, there is reduced time wastage while also cutting the costs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering- guiding generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs
IMPORTANCE OF PROMPT ENGINEERING
  improved user experience- this is beacuse the desired output is generated.
  Reduced post-processing-Prompt engineers can create precise prompts that align with the desired goals of the AI. 
  Reduced bias-bias present in the training data of the AI is reduced.
  Improved accuracy- AI hallucinations are prevented and more accurate data is generated.
  


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: “Tell me everything about…”
Improved prompt: "Tell me everything about Samsung s25 ultra smartphone"
This is beacuse the improved prompt does not leave the Ai guessing nor is it too broad of a topic.
