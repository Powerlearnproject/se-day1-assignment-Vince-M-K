# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is the principled process of designing, building, testing and maintaining software applications.
Its importance are:
  1. It enhances efficiency and productivity- due to software engineering, automation is made possible. There is also  improved communication
  2. Ensures security and reliability- a more robust software is less prone to cyber attacks making it more reliable to its users
  3. improved user experience- a good software should be user friendly due to simplified actions, enhanced accessibilty and it is able to cater for the needs of the users.
  4. it fosters collaboration and sharing of knowledge- team work is introduced thus leading to sharing of knowledge among the team members.
  5. improved environment sustainability- software reduces consumption of energy, it reduces waste and promotes eco-friendly practices.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  1.1945/1946 ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer)-it was the first general-purpose electronic computer that made it possible for stored-program computing.
  2. 1956 FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslation)- it was the first high-level programming language designed for scientific computing.
  3. 1957 COBOL (COmmon Business-Oriented Language)-it was the first programming language designed for businness applications.
  


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  1. Planning- involves gathering of information from the customer and documenting them.
  2. Design- creating blueprints for the software. This include the user interface, system interface and the database.
  3. Testing- this involves checking whether the software is operating correctly and if it meets the required requirements.
  4. Deployment- the software is moved to the working environment. It is installed in devices, configured and the users are trained on how tovuse the software.
  5. Maintenance- the softwareis monitored for performance and security issues that may arise.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
